# Turtle Pattern Generator - Inspired by Brilliant's Creative Coding Course

This project implements and extends the geometric patterns from [Brilliant.org's Creative Coding Course](https://brilliant.org/courses/programming-python/). Using Python's turtle graphics, it creates a variety of geometric patterns demonstrating concepts from basic drawing to complex mathematical positioning.

cd turtle-patterns
```

2. Run the pattern generator:
```bash
python3 src/turtle_patterns.py
```

## 🎯 Pattern Categories

### Original Course Patterns
1. Basic Geometric Shapes
   - Nested shapes with varying rotations
   - Concentric circles with color progression
   - Regular polygons with mathematical spacing

2. Color Patterns
   - Alternating color sequences
   - RGB value progressions
   - Color intensity variations

3. Movement-Based Patterns
   - Conditional positioning
   - Mathematical movement calculations
   - Position-based color changes

4. Conditional Patterns
   - Even/odd positioning
   - Modulo-based coloring
   - Count-based rotations

### Extended Patterns
1. Random Generation
   - Random position circles
   - Random RGB color combinations
   - Size variations

2. Complex Movement
   - Multiple variable updates
   - Combined rotations and translations
   - Mathematical progressions

## 📂 Output Files
The program generates multiple .eps files:
- figures1-5: Basic geometric patterns
- figures6-10: Rotating and alternating patterns
- figures11-16: Movement and modulo patterns
- figures17-20: Complex movement patterns
